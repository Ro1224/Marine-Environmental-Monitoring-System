{"cleanup_strategies": ["", "Oil spills are hazardous as the marine ecosystem is affected, and the marine life-forms existence gets unnecessarily threatened.", "Since oil exploration from oceanic resources has become a must, and oil spills occur accidentally, it becomes important to employ various oil spill cleanup methods.", "Oil is one of the most abundant pollutants in the oceans. About 3 million metric tons of oil contaminates the oceans annually. However, oil spills vary in severity and the extent of damage they cause.", "This can be attributed to variations in the oil type, the location of the spill, and the weather conditions present. In addition, the spread and behaviour of spilt oil in the seas is governed by various chemical, physical and biological processes.", "But irrespective of these, oil spills are a serious concern as they can inflict a lot of damage to the ecosystem.", "The effects are experienced not only in the area of the spill but also expand over vast regions to negatively impact shorelines and terrestrial wildlife thousands of metres away from the site of the spill.", "\n\n\n\n", "Since oil density is lesser than water, it floats on the water surface when it leaks or spills (saltwater or freshwater). It is for this reason that it is much easier to clean up an oil spill.", "It is easy to imagine the difficulty in cleaning up a spill if oil was denser than water, and as a result, formed a layer along the bottom of the seas instead of the surface!", "In recent years, many major oil spills have taken place\u2013 the Exxon Valdez in 1989, the Prestige in 2002, and the Deepwater Horizon in 2010.", "Oil spills will continue to be a pressing problem and source of pollution as long as ships move most of the petroleum products around the world, and exploration of oil from oceanic resources is steadily on the rise.", "Nevertheless, oil spills mostly occur accidentally, and thus it becomes increasingly important to employ various cleanup methods for tacking the menace they could pose to the marine ecosystem.", "Table of Contents", "Different methodologies can be adopted to clean up oil spills.", "Some of the few important and commonly used methods can be explained as follows:", "The use of oil booms is a straightforward and popular method of controlling oil spills. Equipment called containment booms acts like a fence to prevent the oil from further spreading or floating away. Booms float on the water surface and have three parts \u2013", "\u2022 A \u2018freeboard\u2019 is the part that rises above the water surface, containing the oil and preventing it from splashing over the top\n\u2022 A \u2018skirt\u2019 is placed below the surface and keeps the oil from being squeezed under the booms and escaping\n\u2022 A kind of cable or chain that connects the parts to strengthen and stabilize the boom.\nConnected sections of the boom are placed around the oil spill area until it is surrounded and contained.", "Additional Information:", "\u2192 This method is effective only when the oil is in one spot.\n\u2192 It works when the spill is accessible within a few hours of taking place; otherwise, the area of the spill becomes too large to manage\n\u2192 It cannot be successfully employed under rough sea waves, high wind velocities or fluctuating tides.", "Related Read:\u00a0Fighting Oil Spill on Ship", "Once the oil has been confined by using oil booms, skimmers or oil scoops can be deployed onto boats to remove the contaminants from the water surface. Skimmers are machines specially designed to suck up the oil from the water surface like a vacuum cleaner. They are used to physically separate the oil from the water to be collected and processed for re-use.", "Additional Information:", "Sorbents are materials that soak up liquids by either absorption (pulling in through pores) or adsorption (forming a layer on the surface). Both these properties make the process of clean-up much easier. Materials commonly used as oil sorbents are hay, peat moss, straw or vermiculite.", "Additional Information:", "In this method, the oil floating on the surface is ignited to burn it off. This in-situ burning of oil can effectively remove up to 98% of an oil spill, which is more than most other methods.", "According to Obi et al. (2008), \u201cThe minimum concentration (thickness) of the slick on the water surface for any measurable effectiveness of in-situ burning is 3mm. This is because it would be tough (and even nearly impossible) to ignite a layer that is not thick enough.", "Additional Information:", "Related Read:\u00a0The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill: The Complete Story of\u00a0DeepwaterHorizon", "When the spilt oil cannot be contained by using booms, the only option left is to accelerate the disintegration of oil. Dispersal agents, such as Corexit 9500, are chemicals that are sprayed upon the spill with the help of aircraft and boats, which aid the natural breakdown of oil components.", "They allow the oil to chemically bond with water by increasing the surface area of each molecule. This ensures that the slick does not travel over the water\u2019s surface and is easier to degrade by microbes.", "Additional Information:", "Related Read:\u00a0Different Types of Dispersants Used in an Oil Spill", "This procedure is mainly used in situations where the oil is inaccessible to mechanical removal methods such as using booms and skimmers. It is used to dislodge the trapped and weathered oil from locations that are generally inaccessible to machinery.", "Water heaters are used to heat water to around 170\u00b0C, then sprayed by hand with high-pressure wands or nozzles. The oil is thus flushed to the water surface, which can be collected with skimmers or sorbents.", "Additional Information:", "Related Read:\u00a0What is Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP)?", "As the name suggests, the method requires hand-held tools and manual labour to clean up the contaminants. It involves using manual means like hands, rakes, shovels etc., to clean the surface oil and oily debris and place them in special containers to be removed from the shoreline.", "Sometimes, mechanized equipment may be employed for providing any additional help and reach out to any inaccessible areas.", "Additional Information:", "Bioremediation refers to the use of specific microorganisms to remove any toxic or harmful substances. For example, various bacteria, fungi, archaea, and algae degrade petroleum products by metabolizing and breaking them into simpler and non-toxic molecules (mostly fatty acids and carbon dioxide). Sometimes, reagents and fertilizers may be added to the area.", "These phosphorus-based and nitrogen-based fertilizers provide adequate nutrients for the microbes to grow and multiply quickly.", "This process is generally not used when the spill has happened in the deep seas and is gradually implemented once the oil approaches the shoreline.", "Additional Information:", "Right after an oil spill, the immediate concern is to prevent the oil from spreading and contaminating the adjacent areas. While mechanical methods like using oil booms effectively contain the oil, they have certain limitations to their use.", "Experts have recently been using compounds like \u2018Elastol\u2019, which is basically poly iso-butylene (PIB) in a white powdered form, to confine oil spills. The compound gelatinizes or solidifies the oil on the water surface, thus preventing it from spreading or escaping. In addition, the gelatin is easy to retrieve, and this makes the process highly efficient.", "Additional Information:", "The simplest method of dealing with the oil spill cleanup operation is to use the vagaries of nature like the sun, the wind, the weather, tides, or naturally occurring microbes. It is used in certain cases when the shoreline is too remote or inaccessible, or the environmental impact of cleaning up a spill could potentially far outweigh the benefits.", "Due to the constancy of these elements, the oil generally evaporates or is broken down into simpler components.", "Additional Information:", "A pivotal factor in cleaning up an oil spill is the location where it has happened. Most oil spills take place far out in the sea, so they are generally left to decompose in the environment naturally. However, as they get closer to the shores, we gradually begin to treat them.", "The treatments follow a general rule: (All distances measured from the shoreline)", "These are only general rules and can be altered based on the type of oil that has been spilt and the prevailing weather conditions. No two oil spill cases are the same, so each one is evaluated individually based on its own merit.", "You might also like to read:", "\u00a0", "Disclaimer : The information contained in this website is for general information purposes only.
